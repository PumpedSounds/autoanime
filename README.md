trying to make a file that renames its own directory so every time you launch it, the file it looks for to open is different in a range of files
I am trying to first have it rename the numbers of the file it searches for. if 19;+1 so new file is 20. That up until there is no file.
Then I will try to make it loop back around to start the files over again.
